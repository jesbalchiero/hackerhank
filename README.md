# HackerRank Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to HackerRank problems in three programming languages: Go, C#, and TypeScript. Additionally, it includes the solutions necessary to obtain certificates on the platform.

## Supported Languages

- [Go](./Go/)
- [C#](./CSharp/)
- [TypeScript](./TypeScript/)

## Repository Organization

Each language has its own directory within the solution directory, where you'll find solutions to HackerRank problems and files related to certificate acquisition.

## Directory Structure

- `<exercise-name>/go/`: Contains the solution in Go.
- `<exercise-name>/c-sharp/`: Contains the solution in C#.
- `<exercise-name>/ts/`: Contains the solution in TypeScript.
- `skills-certification-test/`: Directory for certifications.
- `skills-certification-test/<certification>`: Directory for solutions generated to obtain the certificate.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to HackerRank for providing such a challenging and educational platform.
